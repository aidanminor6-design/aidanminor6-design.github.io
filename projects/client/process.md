# initial planning
The client fro this orofect is my dad he wants a website to put all of the citations and sources for his book on the history of US yemen relations. My dad wants a website thaat has a timline of events that match up with images of archival documents. soem specific things were a consistenent header and footer across all the pages and a timeline for the archival materials.

# 1st revision
I made one page in wordpress to act as an outline for the other pages. My dad also wanted a page for a bibliography. i used the template used on the first page to act as a baseline for this page the bibliography is just going to be a bunch of citations in chicago format.

# 2nd revision
I realised i needed 3 pages for the project and my dad wanted an about page with some information about the book and himself. i also changes the bibliography page to not be in a chronological order like the archival material and just be a regular chicago style citiation page.

# final touchups
My dad wanted to add an image to the about page and gave me some of the archival materials to add to the archival research page. the rest of the pages just have place holder imformation as my dad has been busy making up hours after the snow storm as he doesnt have snow days and the archival research content isnt chronological as he didnt tell me the eras of the few pieces of materials he gave me.
