		<u>Instructions</u>
		<ol>
			<li>Heat the oven to 350 degrees F with the oven racks in the upper-middle and lower-middle positions. Line two half sheet pans with parchment paper.</li>
			<li>Combine the peanut butter and both sugars in a large bowl. Use a wooden spoon to stir together, then smush the mixture on the sides of the bowl several times to incorporate the sugar.</li>
			<li>Add the egg, baking soda, vanilla, and salt. Stir until really smooth.</li>
			<li>Use a 1 1/2-tablespoon-sized disher to scoop the dough out into 16 rounds, evenly spacing 8 dough rounds per sheet.</li>
			<li>Bake until just set, about 10 minutes, rotating the baking sheets between the racks after about 5 minutes. Let the cookies cool on the sheet pans, set on wire racks, for at least 10 minutes before devouring.</li>
		</ol>
		<ul>
                          <li>use a fork and make hatch marks along the dough to make the cookies cook more evenly</li>
