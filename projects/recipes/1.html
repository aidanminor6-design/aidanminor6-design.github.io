		<u>Instructions</u>
		<ol>
			<li>Adjust the oven racks to the lower-middle and upper-middle positions and preheat the oven to 325Â°F. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
			<li>Whisk the baking soda, salt, and flour in a bowl    and set aside.</li>
			<li>In a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the (melted) butter and sugars at medium speed until smooth, about 1 min. Add the vanilla, egg, and egg yolk and beat on medium to low speed until fully incorporated, about 30 seconds, scraping down the bowl and beater as needed with a rubber spatula.</li>
			<li>Add the dry ingredients and mix on low until combined, about 30 seconds.</li>
			<li>Mix in the chocolate chips until just incorporated.</li>
			<li>Divide the dough into portions, each about half a cup. Roll the cookies into ball and then seperate them into two haves and then stick them back together (We are looking for rough edges). Place the cookies on the baking sheets, spacing them about 2.5 inches apart.</li>
			<li>Bake until the cookies are light golden brown and the edges start to harden but the centers are puffy and still soft, 15-18 mins, switching and rotating the baking sheets halfway through the baking time. Allow the cookies to cool.
