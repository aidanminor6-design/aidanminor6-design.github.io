# The TCP/IP model

The TCP/IP model has 4 layers

## Application

Includes protocols:

- SSH
- WWW
- Email
- VOIP
- SMS

## Transport

Transport is the layer that divides imformation into packets and assigns the destination and source imformation to the packets.

Includes protocols:

- Packets
- TCP
- UDP

### UDP Vs TCP

TCP makes sure that all the imformation gets to its destination and will ask for imformation multiple times if it doesnt get it all but it takes longer becasue of those requests. 

TCP is used for:

- Videos
- Movies
- Images
- ETC.
 
UDP has the data go as quckly as it can by not resending packets if one doesnt make it.  
## Internet

The Internet layer uses the link layer to move and directs the data from one place to another through routers. 

Includes This Protocol:

- IP

## Link

Link is the physical part of the network that carries the data.

Includes protocols:

- Wifi
- Bluetooth
- Ethernet
- LTE
