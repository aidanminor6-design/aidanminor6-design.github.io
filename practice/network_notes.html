                <p>These are some notes on networks from class.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A network protocal are a set of rules that govern how computers communicate.</li>
			<li>A network packet is a small unit of data thats usually part of large set and is sent over a network.</li>
			<li> A header in terms of a network is a bit of data attached to the begining of a packet with imformation like its destinination and place of origin.</li>
			<li> A payload in networks is the part of a packet that contains athe actual data.</li>
			<li>A router is the part of anetwork the directs the data to the specified location.</li>
			<li> A routing table is a data table that acts as a map guiding data to its specified location</li>
			<li> Some of the problems that arise in netwrks is that some routers or devices are connected to more devives than others potentially causing a shutdown of a router.</li>
			<li>since a computer cant arbitrarily know how to navigate a network a device probes the network and maked a routing table to navigate.</li>
			<li>packets are part a of larger piece of imformation almost all the time and there can could potentialy be millions of packets a protocal that is set in place is to have a part number and a # of part in a packet.</li>
			<li>we set a place of origin tag so that if a packet gets lost or corrupted then the device that recived the imformation would send a message backing using the place of origin</li>
			</ul>
